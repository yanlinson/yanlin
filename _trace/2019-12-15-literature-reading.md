## Organize your notes 
1. 书本开头记录人物第一次出现的页码，以及重复出现的意象出现的页码

2. 读完每一章暂停一下，梳理情节发展，列如下清单：characters, setting and developments 


# From passive knowledge to active knowledge 

## Own what you’ve read 

### character 
1. 关注第一次出现的信息

2. 先从不重要的人物开始，just knowing who they are and how they intersect with the plot is enough

3. 再从次重要的人物入手，创建人物特征清单 

### setting 
关注地点之间的联系

### plot
关注 main turning point 

### contextualization 
1. 关注 author
2. publication
3. historical moment 



### Think as a writer
1. Who are the protagonist?

2. Who is the narrator? 

### voice (who is telling the story and how)
1. Narrative voice (first, second, third person— limited, omniscient)

2. Character voice: narrator ≠ author 
    - Narrative voice might miss something. (e.g. action, silence for readers to fill in)
    - Each character is limited to their perspective in their moment. 
    - You can’t always trust characters to know/say what they mean. 

### staging (putting voices in a place and context)

1. Space+Time=Staging

2. Ask yourself why the choices about space and time were made, and how they affect our understanding of the story

3. What we see and what we know: Find out the repeated feature of places to understand why and how the author organized it.
