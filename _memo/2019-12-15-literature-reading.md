# Ways to turn passive knowledge to active knowledge 

## Own what you’ve read 

### character 
关注第一次出现的信息

先从不重要的人物开始，just knowing who they are and how they intersect with the plot is enough

再从次重要的人物入手，创建人物特征清单 

### setting 
关注地点之间的联系

### plot
关注 main turning point 

### contextualization 
关注 author
book
historical moment 



### Things to consider before setting pen to paper
Who are the protagonist?
Who is the narrator? 

### voice (who is telling the story and how)
Narrative voice (first, second, third person— limited, omniscient)
Character voice 			

narrator ≠ author 
Narrative voice might miss something. (e.g. action, silence for readers to fill in)

Each character is limited to their perspective in their moment. 
You can’t always trust characters to know/say what they mean. 

### staging (putting voices in a place and context)

space+time=staging; ask yourself why the choices about space and time were made, and how they affect our understanding of the story

What we see and what we know: Find out the repeated feature of places to understand why and how the author organized it.
