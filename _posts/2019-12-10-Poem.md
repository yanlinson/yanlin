## I’ve Saved The Summer 
by Rod McKuen 

I’ve saved the summer/ And I give it all to you
To hold on winter mornings/ When the snow is new.
我存了些温暖， 全部给你
待到冬日早晨，初雪落下

I've saved some sunlight/ If you should ever need
A place away from darkness/ Where your mind can feed.
我存了些阳光，供你取用
愿你远离黑暗， 心底温暖

And for myself I've kept your smile/ When you were but nineteen
Till you’re older you’ll not know/ What brave young smiles can mean.
我存了些你的笑，给我自己
那年你十九岁
笑得灿烂，多么珍贵

I know no answers/ To help you on your way
The answers lie somewhere/ At the bottom of the day.
我不知道
如何陪你，度过漫长岁月
也许答案就在某处， 日子尽头


But if you've a need for love/ I'll give you all I own
It might help you down the road/ Till you've found your own.
但只要你需要，我会一直爱你
它或可伴你前行
直到遇见，你的爱
