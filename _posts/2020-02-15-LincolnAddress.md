title: 从葛底斯堡演讲想到的
---
 
这周准备网课，林肯先生的葛底斯堡演讲浮现脑海。2.12 号恰逢林肯的生日，于是决定给学生讲讲这​历史名篇。


> 亚伯拉罕·林肯（1809.2.12 – 1865.4.15）第十六任美国总统，他领导美国南北战争,废除奴隶制，并推动经济的现代化。


1863年11月19日，葛底斯堡战役结束四个半月后，林肯在葛底斯堡国家公墓揭幕仪式中发表此演说，哀悼在葛底斯堡之役中阵亡的将士。在演讲中，林肯回顾国家基于何种理念，表达对逝者的敬意，同时激励生者继续前人未竟事业。

看如今我们国家的疫情。那冲在最前线的医务人员，建筑工人，社区工作者、基层公务员、快递小哥，环卫工人还有各种在背后默默奉献的人。他们不正是为了国家，在打一场没有硝烟的战争吗？

我们何其有幸，每当国家遇到挑战，总有逆行者迎难而上。除了心存感激，我们能做些什么？

课上，我给学生提了个问题：**“当危机、挑战乃至机遇到来，你们能否成为自我、家庭乃至国家的担当？”** 

我希望的回答是肯定的。因为只有祖国的未来一代学会担当，我们祖国才能保持活力。

> 愿君崇令德，随时爱景光。

疫情面前，正是反思自我，超越自我的好时机。照顾好自己，配合国家的工作，就是最好的支持。

不囿过往，守望相助，珍惜时间，共同成长，我想这是人性最好的样子。

以下，为学生改写的演讲稿一篇。愿疫情早日结束，国家繁荣昌盛。


## Together, we can make it
About seven decades ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in marxism, dedicated to the proposition that people are the master of the country.

Now, we are engaged in a great war, testing whether Wuhan, and our nation so responsible and dedicated, can survive the epidemic. Though we can not build — we can not cure  — we can not substitute the fact that someone will never come back, it is altogether fitting and proper that we should be involved in supporting those brave men and women in our ways. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they are doing here for our motherland. ​

It’s rather for us to be here dedicated to shouldering the responsibility of protecting and rejuvenating our country. It is rather for us students to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us— that from their endeavors, we take increased devotion to studying hard and forming good habits — that we here highly resolve that we help each other to grow and excel — that the nation shall have a new look in spring — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.


## 葛底斯堡演讲原文


Gettysburg Address
Abraham Lincoln 


Nov. 19, 1863


Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.


八十七年前，我们的父辈在这块大陆上建立了一个新的国家，它孕育于自由，奉行人人生而平等的主张。


Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.


当下，我们正进行一场重要的内战，考验我们父辈建立的那个国家，或任何有此信仰和主张的国家，能否延续。今天，我们相聚这里，在这曾经的战场，为那沙场亡灵，落成最后的安息之地。这本应是我们分内之事。


But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. 


但从更广泛的意义上说，我们无法在此敬献，我们无法在此奉献，我们也无法使这片土地得以圣化；因为，那活着和死去的、那曾在此奋斗拼搏过的勇者，早已做过。我们渺小的力量，远不能增减其一分。各位，世界不会留意，也不会铭记我们在这儿说过什么，但绝不会忘记他们曾在这儿做过什么。 


It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.


而我们活着的，当继续推进他们未竟的事业。我们应致力于眼前伟大的任务---我们应倾心投入，效法先贤，不忘逝者之志；我们更应下定决心，励精图治，以告慰在天亡灵；我们将在上帝的庇佑下，让我们的国家在自由中获得新生；而那为民所有、为民所治、为民所享的政府，也绝不会从这片土地上消亡。
